We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.\n\n- [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org)\n- [Latest Release](https://ghost.org/download/)\n- [Support](http://support.ghost.org/)\n- [Theme Docs](http://themes.ghost.org)\n- [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Feature Requests](http://ideas.ghost.org/)\n- [Dev Blog](http://dev.ghost.org)\n\n\n# Quick Start Install\n\nMake sure you've installed Node.js - We recommend the latest **Node v0.10.x** release.\n\nGhost is also compatible with **Node v0.12** and **io.js v1.2**, but please note that these versions are more likely to run into installation problems. May contain nuts. Please use the [forum](https://ghost.org/forum/installation/) for help.\n\n1. Download the [latest release](https://ghost.org/download/) of Ghost\n1. Unzip in the location you want to install\n1. Fire up a terminal\n1. `npm install --production`\n1. Start Ghost!\n    - Local environment: `npm start`\n    - On a server: `npm start --production`\n1. `http://localhost:2368/ghost` :tada:\n\nMore [install docs](http://support.ghost.org/installation/) here in case you got stuck.\n\n<a name=\"getting-started\"></a>\n# Developer Install (from git)\n\nInstall Node.js. \n\n```bash\n# Node v0.10.x - full support\n# Node v0.12.x and io.js v1.2 - partial support\n#\n# Choose wisely\n```\n\nClone :ghost:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/tryghost/ghost.git\ncd ghost\n```\n\nInstall grunt. No prizes here.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\n```\n\nInstall Ghost. If you're running locally, use [master](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/master). For production, use [stable](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/stable). :no_entry_sign::rocket::microscope:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nBuild the things!\n\n```bash\ngrunt init\n```\n\nMinify that shit for production?\n\n```bash\ngrunt prod\n```\n\nStart your engines.\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n\n## running production? Add --production\n```\n\nCongrats! You made it. BTW you can also just `npm install ghost` if you're into that sort of thing. NPM afficionados can also read up on using [Ghost as an NPM module](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Using-Ghost-as-an-npm-module).\n\nMore general [install docs](http://support.ghost.org/installation/) here in case you got stuck.\n\n\n# Deploying Ghost\n\nThe easiest way to deploy Ghost is on our official <strong><a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\">Ghost(Pro)</a></strong> hosted platform. This service funds the Ghost Foundation, which makes actively maintaining this project possible.\n\nAlso, you get to save yourself a lot of wasted time and headaches by deploying a new instance of Ghost to a managed server with a global content delivery network in just a few clicks.\n\n[Other options](http://support.ghost.org/deploying-ghost/) are available if you prefer playing around with servers by yourself.\n\n\n# Staying Up to Date\n\nWhen a new version of Ghost comes out, you'll want to look over these [upgrade instructions](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/) for what to do next.\n\nYou can talk to other Ghost users on [our forums](https://ghost.org/forum) or chat with Ghost developers in our [public Slack team](https://ghost.org/slack/) (it's pretty awesome). We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm London time.\n\nNew releases are announced on the [dev blog](http://dev.ghost.org/tag/releases/). You can subscribe by email or follow [@TryGhost_Dev](https://twitter.com/tryghost_dev) on Twitter, if you prefer your updates bite-sized and facetious.\n\n:saxophone::turtle:\n\n\n# Copyright & License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2015 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n",
